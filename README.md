## AirBnB Listing Price Recommendation with Image-Based Machine Learning/Deep Learning Methods. 

This project employs multiple regression, neural networks and ensemble methods to train models to predict listing prices based on Singapore AirBnB data in 2019. The models involve various features extracted from AirBnB website public data coupled with engineered features so as to generate a model which provides reasonable pricing for a given listing with necessary information. This model can be used to advise price for property owners who are deciding what is the price for their listings. Data exploration also suggests business insights about how to strategically set up the listing features in order to increase possible price offer for a property.
